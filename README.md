# Tensorflow-Advanced-Techniques-Specialization
This specialization gives you the power of flexibility which is not provided fully by the Tensorflow Keras.

You can make Functional API models instead of sticking to just Sequential Models.
It allows us to make Custom Models, Custom Layers, Custom Losses using Tensorflow.
Moreover, one can understand Wrapper Functions and Limitations of using Sequential or Functional API models with the benefits of using Subclasses Models.
